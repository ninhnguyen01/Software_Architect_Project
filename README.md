<h1>Software Architecture</h1>

Describes how an application is built including its components, how they interact with each other, environment in which they operate and so on.

<h2>Levels of Architecture</h2>

<p><b>Application Level</b>: The lowest level of architecture. Focus on one single application. Very detailed, low level design. Communication is usually within one development team.</p>
<p><b>Solution Level</b>: The mid-level of architecture. Focus on one or more applications which fulfill a business need (business solution). Some high, but mainly low-level design. Communication is between multiple development teams.</p>
<p><b>Enterprise Level</b>: The highest level of architecture. Focus on multiple solutions. High level, abstract design, which needs to be detailed out by solution or application architects. Communication is across the organization.</p>
